# HackerNews_Dataquest_Project

 This project is a guided project completed as part of the "Data Scientist in Python" curriculum on Dataquest.io. The project covers data cleaning and the use of the datetime package to find out during which hours posts receive the most comments.

# Methods
Some of the methods and packages used include:
1. csv file importing and reading
2. datetime package
3. for loops
4. random sampling

# About The data:
ü§òüèª The original data set from Kaggle were extracted in 2016 which contains 300,000 rows , we will only be working with 20,000 rows, since posts without comments were removed and then randomly sampled from the remaining submissions.

# Hypotesis
 For the purpose of this project, we will compare the two types of posts to determine the following:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
